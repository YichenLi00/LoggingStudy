# README
We have open-sourced the code for the baselines we use. For the released model, we have open-sourced the code. For APIs, we have open-sourced the invocation scripts. As for those commercial plugins, due to usage restrictions, they can only be invoked manually.

For each baseline utilized, we kindly request that please ensure to cite the relevant paper.
